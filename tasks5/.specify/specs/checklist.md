**Purpose**: Ensure all core features and requirements of the task manager are implemented and verified.
**Created**: [DATE]
**Feature**: Task Manager CLI (see spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Core Features

- [ ] CHK001 Can add a new task with a title using `add` command
- [ ] CHK002 Can list all tasks with correct status symbols (✓/✗)
- [ ] CHK003 Can mark a task as completed by ID using `complete` command
- [ ] CHK004 Can delete a task by ID using `delete` command
- [ ] CHK005 Tasks are persisted in `tasks.json` file with proper formatting

## Data Integrity

- [ ] CHK006 Task IDs are auto-incremented sequentially
- [ ] CHK007 Tasks have all required fields: id, title, completed
- [ ] CHK008 JSON file is created if it doesn't exist on first run
- [ ] CHK009 Completed status defaults to False for new tasks

## User Interface

- [ ] CHK010 Prints confirmation message after adding a task

## Edge Cases

- [ ] CHK015 Handles empty task lists gracefully (list command shows nothing)
- [ ] CHK016 Handles multi-word task titles correctly
- [ ] CHK017 Complete/delete commands handle non-existent IDs (currently silent)
- [ ] CHK018 Handles missing command arguments with error message

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
